# Pima CC CIS131 Homework Assignment #8

Simplistic Database Driver Program

This program is an attempt to implement as generic as possible, a simplistic database driver program. As a demonstration, the program uses the very basic Book class, which contains 4 fields (the ISBN field is set as the database key field).

Notes:
* The 2 nested classes of this program (Record and Database) should be separated for readability/maintainability purposes in future versions. 
* Compiled with java SE JDK 8, Update 102 (JDK 8u102).

Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of PCC CIS-131.
