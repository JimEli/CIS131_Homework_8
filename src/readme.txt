Sir,

This new version allows building a database upon a generic class. Inside it includes a second zip file (EliJames_HW8_Car.zip) demonstrating the ease of creating additional databases using the this methodology.

Submission of zip archive of 4 files.

After testing the random access demonstration program (StockItemManager.java), I noticed a limitation related to the key field needing to be consecutively numbered. As is, non-consecutive numbers cause significant problems if a record deletion is attempted. And how can a proper database not allow deletions?

My program attempts to solve this shortcoming without too much obscuration. I fully understand I haven't captured all the pitfalls of deleting, however I hope this represents a foundation on which to build.
